Small advancement through coding

Machine learning and computer vision lead to AI implementation in real-world healthcare. The ever-increasing population and limited number with limited reach of experts created a need for helping hands from computers. Relying on extensive power of computation and big data capabilities there is huge potential for AI to uplift human healthcare. But these advancements necessitate incredibly difficult work of training machines to replicate human abilities of real-world evidence analysis, interpretation and making decisions about the diagnosis.

A computer uses various algorithms and immense power of processing for making a faster and very accurate diagnosis than a physician could make.
